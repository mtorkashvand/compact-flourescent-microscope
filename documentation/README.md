This is to navigate to different sections of the documentation for OpenAutoScope2.0. The tutorials provided cover a range of topics including assembling the system,
installing the software, configuring the necessary parameters, performing calibration, preparing samples for optimal results, and conducting imaging sessions on the prepared samples.
You can refer to the specific sections that align with your current needs and requirements.

## [Printed Circuit Board](../pcb)

The manufacturing of the printed circuit board (PCB) typically requires a certain amount of time. There are multiple vendors available, both within and outside the US, that handle PCB production. We used EasyEDA for designing the PCB and ordering it, including the soldered components.

## [Sample Preparation](sample_preparation.md)
The purpose of the protocol is to ensure optimal performance of the tracking algorithm by emphasizing the importance of sample preparation. To achieve precise z tracking during imaging and effectively image single neurons, it is recommended to prepare the sample on glass. For improved tracking accuracy, it is advised to prepare agar plates with a low peptone percentage and seed them with a small amount of OP50 close to the experiment's execution, minimizing food residues in the recordings. Additionally, creating thin agar plates and utilizing agarose or noble agar enhances sample transparency, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the recordings.
